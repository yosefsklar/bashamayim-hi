# Bashamayim-Hi  בשמים היא
Climb your up the heavens while showing relying on your knowledge of Tanakh. It's Doodle Jump with a catch - you can only jump on clouds containing words that continue the text! Use it to study the weekly Parasha or Haftorah, the daily 929 Perek or any other Perek in Tanakh.
